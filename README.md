# chat-app-mini-project

We implemented a chat web app that will implement the following user stories:
 - I login to my application using my Google Email account
 - I can discover everyone in the system by searching for their name or email address
 - I can write messages to anyone I chose


To implement Google Login:Google OAuth 2.0  
To Store Chat messages: JSON  
We used REST APIs to communicate between a React Frontend and a python backend  
We use the TextBlob library to conduct sentiment analysis of the messages  
Unit testing is implemented in test_server.py and Github Actions are setup to automatically conduct testing on every push
